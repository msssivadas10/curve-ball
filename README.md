# curve-ball

Simulating the curveball in football with simple physics. In modelling the physics, the only forces considered are the gravity, 
drag and magnus force. Forces like wind are not considered. Also, the ball is assumed as a smooth sphere. 

This code is based on the paper *“The aerodynamics of the beautiful game”* by John W. M. Bush.
